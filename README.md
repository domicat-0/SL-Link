# Simply Love Link
A fork of Simply Love designed for ITGMania, with online multiplayer functionality (rooms and tournaments).

## Installation instructions
- Ensure that you are using ITGmania, rather than StepMania or Outfox, as otherwise the theme will not work since no online functionality exists.
- Download the theme, and move it into your Themes folder.
- [Download the pack](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ga9ucc6k1xekq8vs3ykt4/AGL5HkmAlHHXMwO-C-iPMdU?rlkey=9d25wmxwin9xo8os5qx0l4m75&st=5ox76ftd&dl=0), and add it to your Songs folder (note: the folder must be named “SL-Link Season 0” without quotes, as otherwise it will not be found by ITGmania).
- Open your Preferences.ini (found in the Save folder), and find HttpAllowHosts. Add link-server-next.fly.dev to the list, inserting a comma if necessary.
